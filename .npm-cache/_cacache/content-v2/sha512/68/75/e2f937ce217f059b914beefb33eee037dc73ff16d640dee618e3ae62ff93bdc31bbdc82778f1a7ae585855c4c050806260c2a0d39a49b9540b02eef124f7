Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

Checkpoint provides version information and security alerts for your products.\n\n```ts\nimport checkpoint from 'checkpoint-client'\n\ncheckpoint.check({\n  product: 'prisma',\n  version: '2.0.0',\n})\n```\n\n## Features\n\n- No impact on the developer experience of your CLI\n- Easily hook into any product\n- Bring your own styles\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\nnpm install checkpoint-client\n```\n\n## API\n\n### `checkpoint.check(input: Input): Promise<Result>`\n\nCheck for the latest version and inform the user of any security notices.\n\n```ts\nawait checkpoint.check({\n  product: 'prisma',\n  version: '2.0.0',\n})\n```\n\n#### `Input`\n\n|              Field |     Attributes      | Description                                                               |\n| -----------------: | :-----------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n|          `product` | _string, required_  | Name of the product.

This status is influenced by the `remind_duration`.\n\n```ts\ntype Result = {\n  status: 'reminded'\n  data: Output\n}\n```\n\nIn both cases, the `Output` has the following shape:\n\n|                   Field |     Attributes      | Description                                      |\n| ----------------------: | :-----------------: | :----------------------------------------------- |\n|               `product` | _string, required_  | Product we're checking on.                       |\n|       `current_version` | _string, required_  | Latest version of the product.                   |\n|  `current_release_date` | _number, required_  | Release date of the latest version in Unix time. |\n|  `current_download_url` | _string, required_  | URL to download the latest version.              |\n| `current_changelog_url` | _string, required_  | URL to the latest version's changelog.           |\n|       `project_website` | _string, required_  | Website for the project.                         |\n|              `outdated` | _boolean, required_ | True if the our version is outdated.             |\n|              `alerts[]` | _Alert[], required_ | New security alerts or notices for this version. |\n|                   `.id` | _string, required_  | ID of the alert.                                 |\n|                 `.date` | _string, required_  | Date of the alert in Unix time.                  |\n|              `.message` | _string, required_  | Alert message.                                   |\n|                  `.url` | _string, optional_  | URL for more information about the alert.        |\n|                `.level` | _string, required_  | Severity of the alert.                           |\n\n##### `status: \"waiting\"`\n\nThe `waiting` status occurs when we don't have the cached result and we're requesting it from the checkpoint server.\n\n```ts\ntype Result = {\n  status: 'waiting'\n  data: ChildProcess\n}\n```\n\nIf you like, you can pass `unref: false` as input and wait for the `ChildProcess` to exit. The child process prints out the `Output` to stdout. You can see an example in [check-version](./examples/check-version.ts).\n\n##### `status: \"disabled\"`\n\nThe `disabled` status occurs when we've explicitly disabled this service. The most common case for this is in CI.\n\n```ts\ntype Result = {\n  status: 'disabled'\n}\n```\n\nYou can see an example for this in [is-ci](./examples/is-ci.ts).\n\n#### Environment variables\n\n|                Field |     Attributes     | Description                                    |\n| -------------------: | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------- |\n| `CHECKPOINT_DISABLE` | _string, optional_ | Disable the checkpoint client                  |\n| `CHECKPOINT_TIMEOUT` | _string, optional_ | Globally set timeout for our checkpoint client |\n\n## Clearing the Cache\n\n```\n// macOS\nls ~/Library/Caches/checkpoint-nodejs\nrm -rf ~/Library/Caches/checkpoint-nodejs\n\n// Windows\nC:\\Users\\Jan\\AppData\\Local\\checkpoint-nodejs\n\n// Linux\n$XDG_CACHE_HOME/checkpoint-nodejs\nOr\n$HOME - /home/.cache/checkpoint-nodejs\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nYou can use `ts-node` to run the examples:\n\n```ts\nnpm install\nnpm run build\nnode dist/examples/is-ci.js\n```\n\n- [update-notifier example](./examples/update-notifier.ts)\n- [Wait for version example](./examples/check-version.ts)\n- [CI example](./examples/is-ci.ts)\n\n## Publishing a new version on npm\n\n1.
